# HELIOS-EXPLORER

This project dig in the deep insights of how Nasa’s one of the most eminent satellite PARKER SOLAR PROBE takes a journey around the sun to witness some amazing facts. You will get to know trajectory PSP is going to follow and what are its application. This app is highly engaging and user interactive. The technology used is virtual reality . It also explains the significance of  venus’ gravitational field strength in the process of reaching around sun.. The visualization can easily make a layman understand of what is happening in one of the most complex missions of all  times.
